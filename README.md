# Ecommerce Demo

This is my Ecommerce Demo! It is my submission for the Week 13 challenge on Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). I built the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. Please enjoy!
